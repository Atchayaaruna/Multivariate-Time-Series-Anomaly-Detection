# Multivariate-Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection
This project implements an MLP Windowed Autoencoder to detect anomalies in multivariate time-series data such as industrial sensor readings or IoT metrics. It learns normal patterns from historical data using overlapping windows and flags abnormal behaviour through reconstruction error mapped to a 0â€“100 anomaly score.
